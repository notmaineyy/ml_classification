# Enhancing Multi-class Image Classification using Data Augmentation

This project is to address the problem of having difficulties classifying items, due to the imbalanced dataset, with low data count for certain classes.
Dataset is not provided in this repo, but Python files can be reused for any dataset.

## Data Augmentation Methods Experimented:
1. Traditional Methods<br>
   a. Flipping<br>
   b. Contrasting<br>
   c. Brightening<br>
   d. Sharpening<br>
2. Modern Methods<br>
   a. Generative Adverserial Network<br>
   b. Generative AI

After experimenting with various methods, the best augmentation methods were combined to increase the quantity of training and validation data. The data distribution can be seen here:

The final outcome is the following:
